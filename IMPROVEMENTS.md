# RunTracker - Bug Fixes and Feature Improvements

## 🐛 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Timer Calculation Bug
**Issue**: The pause/resume functionality had incorrect time calculations
- **Problem**: `getCurrentTime()` method used `this.startTime` when paused, creating circular calculations
- **Fix**: Added `pauseStartTime` tracking and corrected the elapsed time calculation
- **Impact**: Timer now accurately tracks time during pause/resume cycles

### 2. GPS Distance Filtering Bug
**Issue**: Overly restrictive GPS distance filtering
- **Problem**: Filter rejected distances > 100m between GPS readings, blocking legitimate movement
- **Fix**: Changed filter to reject distances > 500m and added accuracy threshold (< 100m accuracy)
- **Impact**: Better distance tracking for walking and running activities

### 3. Pause Logic Bug
**Issue**: Incorrect pause time accumulation
- **Problem**: Pause time was calculated incorrectly when resuming
- **Fix**: Track pause start time separately and accumulate pause duration properly
- **Impact**: Accurate time tracking during multiple pause/resume cycles

### 4. Performance Issue
**Issue**: Excessive timer updates
- **Problem**: Timer updated every 100ms causing unnecessary CPU usage
- **Fix**: Reduced update frequency to 1000ms (1 second)
- **Impact**: Better battery life and performance, especially on mobile devices

### 5. Service Worker Error
**Issue**: Missing service worker file causing console errors
- **Problem**: Code referenced non-existent `sw.js` file
- **Fix**: Removed service worker registration code
- **Impact**: Clean console output, no more 404 errors

### 6. Activity Selection Bug
**Issue**: Could change activity type while paused
- **Problem**: Activity buttons were only disabled when running, not when paused
- **Fix**: Disable activity selection when both running AND paused
- **Impact**: Prevents accidental activity type changes during workouts
