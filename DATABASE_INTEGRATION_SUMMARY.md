## 🔄 Migration Process

### Automatic Migration
1. **Detection**: App checks for existing localStorage data on startup
2. **Migration**: Automatically sends data to `/api/migrate` endpoint
3. **Verification**: Confirms successful migration
4. **Backup**: Keeps localStorage as backup initially
5. **Notification**: User informed of migration status

### Manual Migration
```javascript
// Trigger manual migration
const activities = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('runtracker_activities') || '[]');
fetch('/api/migrate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ activities })
});
```
