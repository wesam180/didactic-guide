# RunTracker Bug Fixes & Improvements Summary

This document outlines all the bugs that were fixed and improvements made to the RunTracker application.

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

### 1. GPS Distance Calculation Bug
**Issue**: The GPS filtering logic was too restrictive, filtering out valid distance readings between 0.001km and 0.1km.
**Fix**: 
- Improved filtering criteria to accept distances between 0.001km (1m) and 1km
- Added GPS accuracy checking (< 100m accuracy requirement)
- Only record positions when actually running

### 2. Timer Logic Issue
**Issue**: Pause/resume functionality had incorrect time calculations.
**Fix**:
- Added `pauseStartTime` tracking to record exact pause moment
- Fixed resume calculation to use actual pause duration
- Reset `lastPosition` on fresh starts to prevent GPS calculation errors

### 3. Pace Calculation Edge Cases
**Issue**: Pace calculation could result in NaN or invalid values.
**Fix**:
- Added bounds checking in `formatPace()` function
- Cap pace at reasonable maximum (60 minutes per km)
- Handle division by zero and infinite values
- Improved display for extreme pace values

### 4. GPS Error Handling
**Issue**: Poor user feedback for GPS errors and no recovery mechanism.
**Fix**:
- Enhanced error messages with actionable guidance
- Added automatic retry for GPS timeout errors
- Visual highlighting of manual distance input when GPS fails
- Better status indicators for different GPS states

### 5. Missing Service Worker
**Issue**: JavaScript attempted to register `sw.js` but file didn't exist.
**Fix**: Created comprehensive service worker with:
- Offline caching functionality
- Background sync capabilities
- Cache management and updates
- Fallback handling for offline usage

## ‚ú® New Features Added

### 1. Toast Notifications
- Added user-friendly notification system
- Success and error message variants
- Automatic dismissal with smooth animations
- Used throughout the app for feedback

### 2. Data Export Functionality
- Export activity history to CSV format
- Includes all relevant metrics (date, type, duration, distance, pace, speed)
- Automatic filename with current date
- Browser compatibility checking

### 3. Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Spacebar**: Start/Pause/Resume activity
- **S**: Stop current activity
- **R**: Switch to running mode (when not active)
- **W**: Switch to walking mode (when not active)
- **1/2/3**: Switch between Tracker/History/Stats tabs
- Input field detection to prevent conflicts

### 4. Enhanced Manual Distance Input
- Visual feedback when GPS fails (highlighted input)
- Confirmation messages when distance is set
- Input validation with error messages
- Reset styling when GPS recovers

### 5. Improved GPS Tracking
- GPS accuracy tracking and storage
- Better position filtering algorithm
- Smarter GPS retry mechanism
- Enhanced status reporting

## üé® UI/UX Improvements
